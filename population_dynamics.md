# Population dynamics

This project is mainly concerned with the study of nonlinear models describing populations.
The purpose is to describe physically the model, and than analyze its stability, evolution, bifurcations, etc.

Here we have:

* study of the first simple model proposed by [Volterra](Notebooks/01.Simple_Model.ipynb) 
* analysis of the the simple model in a [Non-dimensional form](Notebooks/02.Simple_Model_Nondimensionalization.ipynb) 
* study of the Lotka-Volterra model, supposing both species have finite carrying capacity: [LV](Notebooks/03.LV_Model.ipynb) 
* analysis of the model with finite carrying capacity: [LV Non-dimensional form](Notebooks/04.LV_Model_NonDim.ipynb)

* TODO  


## Lotka-Volterra equations - simple model
The Lotka-Volterra equations are a system of differential equations that describe the dynamics of a pair of species that interact, one as a predator and the other as a prey, in fact they are also called the __Predator–Prey Model__

Volterra (1926) first proposed a simple model for the predation of one species by another to explain the oscillatory levels of certain fish catches in the Adriatic.
It is known as the __Lotka–Volterra__ model since the same equations were also derived by Lotka (1920; see also 1925) from a hypothetical chemical reaction which he said could exhibit periodic behavior in the chemical concentrations. 

The same equations can describe the __Lotka-Volterra model of competition__, as long as you choose correctly the sign of the constants.
