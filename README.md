# Nonlinear system simulation

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter Notebook (IPython Notebook) which illustrates some [__Population dynamics__](population_dynamics.md) models.

## Getting Started

The project can be seen, as is,  on your browser, since Jupyter/IPython notebook (`.ipynb`) files will render directly on GitHub, see more [here](http://blog.jupyter.org/rendering-notebooks-on-github-f7ac8736d686).

Otherwise in order to have the code up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes you have to install  Jupyter, you can find more info online starting from this [link](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html)


### Prerequisites

You need to install Python, with: `numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`, `sympy` and `jupyter`.
You can easily have them all by installing [Anaconda](http://www.anaconda.com/download/).
